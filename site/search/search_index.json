Pheasant is a Markdown converter which is designed to work with MkDocs as a plugin. Highlights include: Auto generation of outputs for a fenced code block or inline code in Markdown source using Jupyter client . The code language is not restricted to Python. Auto numbering of headers, figures, tables, and etc. Numbered objects can be linked from other Markdown sources. 1.2 Installation You can install Pheasant from PyPI. $ pip install pheasant If you use Pheasant as a plugin of MkDocs, you also need to install it. $ pip install mkdocs In your mkdocs.yml , add lines below to register Pheasant as a MkDocs plugin. plugins: - pheasant 1.3 Getting Started 1.3.1 Auto generation of the executed outputs with Jupyter client In a markdown fenced code below, ```python print(1) ``` a print function is executed via Jupyter client and converted into HTML: <div class=\"input\"><pre><code class=\"python\">print(1)</code></pre></div> <div class=\"stdout\"><pre><code class=\"nohighlight\">1</code></pre></div> Then, finally rendered as: print(1) [1] 2019-11-07 21:41:46 ( 7.35ms ) python3 ( 7.35ms ) 1 Other language code can be executed if a kernel for the language has been installed. For example, ```julia println(\"Hello, IJulia!\") ``` println(\"Hello, IJulia!\") [2] 2019-11-07 21:41:53 ( 503ms ) julia-1.1 ( 503ms ) Hello, IJulia! You can check the kernel name and its total execution time during the conversion process at the right side of an input cell. Like Jupyter Notebook , the last object in a code cell is displayed as the output of the cell. ```python greeting = 'Hello, Python' greeting ``` greeting = 'Hello, Python' greeting [3] 2019-11-07 21:41:53 ( 7.01ms ) python3 ( 14.4ms ) 'Hello, Python' 1.3.2 Inline code embeded in a Markdown source \"Inline code\" is a powerful feature of Pheasant. Any executable codes surrounded by {{ and }} are automatically executed and the codes are replaced with the execution result. For example, {{3*4}} becomes 12. Variables can be assigned in an inline code like this: {{name='Pheasant'}} . Then, \"I'm {{name}}.\" becomes \"I'm Pheasant.\" 1.3.3 Visualization Pheasant supports various output formats other than the standard stream ( stdout / stderr ) or a plain text output. For example, you can create a PNG image using Matplotlib . First, import the Matplotlib plotting library. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` import matplotlib.pyplot as plt [7] 2019-11-07 21:41:53 ( 128ms ) python3 ( 162ms ) Plot a line. ```python plt.plot([1, 2]) ``` plt.plot([1, 2]) [8] 2019-11-07 21:41:53 ( 135ms ) python3 ( 297ms ) [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x17b8247adc8>] Execution of the above Markdown source on a Jupyter client creates a plain text output as an execute result and a PNG image as display data. You may want to display only the image. You can set inline option to a fenced code after a language identifier: ```python inline plt.plot([1, 3]) ``` Or use an inline code directly: {{plt.plot([1, 4])}} 1.3.4 Auto numbering of headers, figures, tables, etc . As you can see, all of headers are numbered in this document. This numbering has done by Pheasant automatically. In addition, Pheasant can count the number of figures, tables, etc . and give the identical number to each object. You can use a special \"header\" statement for figure, table, etc . to number them like below: #Fig Markdown link for an image can be numbered. {#cat#} ![jpg](img/cat.jpg) Figure 1 Markdown link for an image can be numbered. Supported numbered headers are shown in Table 1 : Table 1 Supported numbered headers Type Markdown (case-insensitive) Header # (title) Figure #Figure (title), #Fig (title) Table #Table (title), #Tab (title) Equation #Eq (equation), #Eq* (equation) [other] #[other] (title) In the above Markdown source, {#<tag>#} is an ID tag for hyperlink described below. Off course, you can use any codes to create a figure. #Figure A Matplotlib figure ```python plt.plot([2, 4]) ``` Figure 2 A Matplotlib figure Like figures, tables can be numbered. #Table A Markdown table a | b --|-- 0 | 1 2 | 3 Table 2 A Markdown table a b 0 1 2 3 Pandas 's DataFarme is useful to create a table programmatically. #Table A Pandas's DataFrame ```python import pandas as pd pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]], index=list('XY'), columns=list('ab')) ``` Table 3 A Pandas's DataFrame a b X 1 2 Y 3 4 A plain Markdown source which is not processed by Pheasant has to be separated by a blank line from the following Markdown source which is not a part of the figure or table. If a figure or table has blank lines within it, you have to write the content in a fenced code with tilde ( ~~~ ). #Fig A figure with a blank line ~~~ ![jpg](img/cat.jpg) ![jpg](img/cat.jpg) ~~~ Figure 3 A figure with a blank line In addition, Pheasant provides an easy way to number objects regardless of whether they actually have any blank lines or not. Try this: #Figure {{plt.plot([1, 5])}} Numbered figure using an inline code. Figure 4 Numbered figure using an inline code. 1.3.5 Hyperlink Numbered objects are linked from Markdown source using {#<tag>#} : For example, go to Fig. {#cat#} For example, go to Fig. 1 You can add an external link in a header. #### MkDocs (https://www.mkdocs.org/) 1.3.5.1 MkDocs 1.3.6 Inspect source (Python only) inspect option to get source. 1.3.6.1 Source code in a code cell ```python inspect def func(x): return x + 2 func ``` def func(x): return x + 2 func?

Following User Guide \"Embedding Plots and Apps\" from the official Bokeh documents, Pheasant automatically adds extra stylesheet and javascript in HTML source. You don't need to configure extra_css and extra_javascript in your mkdocs.yml manually. In order to embed plots in your document, bokeh.embed.components function can be used. This function returns <script> and <div> tags in HTML format. For example: from bokeh.plotting import figure from bokeh.embed import components plot = figure(plot_width=250, plot_height=250) plot.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 3, 3, 2, 4], size=10) script, div = components(plot) print('[script]:', script[:140].strip(), '...') print('[div]:', div[:40].strip(), '...') [5] 2019-11-07 21:41:55 ( 46.1ms ) python3 ( 1.39s ) [script]: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (function() { var fn = function() { Bokeh.safely(function() { (func ... [div]: <div class=\"bk-root\" id=\"2e51e496-3973- ... Pheasant uses this functionality inside automatically. You can get a Bokeh plot just write {{plot}} : (function() { var fn = function() { Bokeh.safely(function() { (function(root) { function embed_document(root) { var docs_json =

list"},{"location":"user-guide/script/","text":"5 Standalone Script Using Atom's Hydrogen package, you can execute any Python script codes within a fenced code block in a Markdown source. So you can edit your code verifying its execution results. But unfortunately (as long as I know), the entire Markdown source cannot be executed all at once as a standalone script and cannot be ran by Python interpreter. Pheasant connects between a pure Python script and a Markdown source. Actually, this page is written by a pure Python code. 5.1 How to A basic idea is that Markdown cells and Python code cells generally appear alternately. We can write a Markdown cell with a successive comment lines. In order to be recognized as a Markdown cell, # must be at the begining of lines. But we can insert a blank line to make a paragraph. Normal Python code is treated as a code cell as you expect. A code cell can contain any comments as long as the comments don't start at the begining of line. def add(x: int, y: int) -> int: \"\"\"Add `x` and `y`.\"\"\" return x + y # a comment in a code cell. def sub(x: int, y: int) -> int: \"\"\"Substract `y` from `x`.\"\"\" return x - y # a comment in a code cell. [1] 2019-11-11 14:27:51 ( 6.05ms ) python3 ( 6.05ms ) When a comment starts at the begining of line after a code block, it divides the source into a code cell and a Markdown cell. This new Markdown cell will continue until next Python code appears. If you want to include a comment at the begining of line, you can write like this: # !First comment in a code cell. a = 1 becomes # First comment in a code cell. a = 1 [2] 2019-11-11 14:27:51 ( 4.97ms ) python3 ( 11.0ms ) Despite of a Markdown cell, you may want to devide successive codes into separate cells. This can be done by putting a special inline comment to define a cell. The comment pattern is # - . For example, # * a markdown cell a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 a # - b becomes a markdown cell a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 a [3] 2019-11-11 14:27:52 ( 7.01ms ) python3 ( 18.0ms ) 1 b [4] 2019-11-11 14:27:52 ( 8.99ms ) python3 ( 27.0ms ) 2 You can add options to a code block by adding them after a cell devider. # -hide d = 4 # * Output: `d` is equal to {{d}}. Above python code is equivalent to the next Markdown source. ```python hide d = 4 ``` * Output: `d` is equal to {{d}}. Then you can hide the python code cell. Output: d is equal to 4. 5.2 Fenced code block in Python source You can write a fenced code block in a Python source as comment. # ```python # print(1) # ``` becomes: print(1) [7] 2019-11-11 14:27:52 ( 9.00ms ) python3 ( 51.0ms ) 1 And, # ~~~ # ```python # print(1) # ``` # ~~~ becomes: ```python print(1) ``` 5.3 A package for comment formatting In this scheme, we have to write many comments for Markdown cells. But a linter such as pycodestyle doesn't allow us to write a very long comment in one line longer than (for example) 79 characters.
