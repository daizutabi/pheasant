## Description

Pheasant is a Markdown converter which is designed to be used as a plugin for static site generators, especially MkDocs. The one of the main features of Pheasant is auto Markdown generation of outputs after execution of any Python codes described in a fenced code block of Markdown source. This processure is done by the Jupyter client functionality. In addition to the code execution, Pheasant can automatically number headers, figures, tables, *etcs*.
