# # Standalone Script

# Using Atom [Hydorgen](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/), you can
# execute any part of Python script code in Atom editor. So you can edit your
# Markdown verifing its execution and outputs. But unfortunately, the entire
# Markdown source cannot be executed all at once as a standalone program or
# cannot be ran by Python interpreter. Pheasant connects between a pure python
# script and structured Markdown representation for MkDocs.
